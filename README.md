### Hi there, I'm Chiyeung Law (Ziyang Luo in Pinyin)! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Hello! I am a third-year PhD Candidate in computer science at [HKBU](https://www.hkbu.edu.hk/). My objective is to develop intelligent agents capable of engaging in multi-turn dialogues with humans using natural language, and interacting with both digital and physical environments through programming. These agents will have self-improvement mechanisms that allow them to learn from automated observations, including the results of their code executions and errors encountered, as well as to combine feedback provided in human language. To break it down further:
  - **Foundation Models**: Large Foundation Code Models, Code Models Alignment, etc.
  - **Applications**: Foundation Models as Code Agents, Code Intelligence, etc.
  - See my [HomePage](https://chiyeunglaw.github.io/) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=VI8NeJEAAAAJ&scilu=&scisig=AMD79ooAAAAAYMxBgnK7-PSdKhN-kFGySA7spa0QvNeW&gmla=AJsN-F4V5zVUeu6rTTWvE8PpY6M4iw95YCKPXt5NWqsXf5IciUgulOtAZOnsaDhSAH_lVmNmjwT2_cC7zWB6CRW5VTa5SGglj22ioALIJecqjCQTc7Bg6gc&sciund=10080338056986852116) for more about me and my research.
- ðŸŒ± I am proud of being the co-first author of the well-known code LLM, [WizardCoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08568).
- ðŸ¤” **I am seeking a place to be a visiting Ph.D. student (Self-Funded) on LLMs/LMMs as Code Agents. If you are interested in my work, please contact me.**
